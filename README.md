# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
My work raises important Questions about how dangerous it is to the population of India.

The Questions that arises are:
  1) What are the top Countries in India were most affected by SARS CoV-2 ?
  2) What is the Mortality rate of every state in India?
  3) Visualize the Death, Confirmed and Mortality rate using Indian map with states.
  4) Classify the cases with the Age count in 4 Categories (children, young adults, middle-aged adults, old-aged adults) using Bar chart with horizintal orientation.
